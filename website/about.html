        <p class="intro">
          At ASCEND, we believe that code is more than just syntax â€” it's a
          superpower that can create impact, spark innovation, and bring ideas
          to life. We are a student-led
          <span class="highlight"> coding club </span>driven by curiosity,
          creativity, and collaboration. Our mission is to create a space where
          aspiring developers, designers, and tech enthusiasts come together to
          build, learn, and grow. From
          <span class="highlight">
            hands-on workshops and hackathons to speaker sessions and community
            projects </span
          >, ASCEND is where students rise through code and discover their true
          potential. Whether you're a beginner writing your first "Hello World"
          or an experienced coder looking to push boundaries, there's a place
          for you here. <br /><span class="highlight"
